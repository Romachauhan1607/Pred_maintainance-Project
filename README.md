# Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction for Turbofan Engines
Predicts RUL based on sensor data
### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the remaining useful life of aircraft turbofan engines. The Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is the amount of cycles an engine has left before it needs maintenance.
